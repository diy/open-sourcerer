# Hi! 
This is a repository for the DIY Makers who are earning the Open Sourcer Skill.

We'll use the files in this repository to learn how to be open sourcerers - sharing and collaborating on ideas! 

Visit the [DIY Open Sourcerer Skill Page](http://www.diy.org/skills/OpenSourcerer) and the [Open Sourcerer Guide](http://opensourcerer.diy.org) that walks users through Git and GitHub.
