Once upon a time, in a galaxy far, far away.  Things happened! It was snowy and sunny at the same time. 

Then, one day, something very, very big happened. A boy named Sue suddenly appeared! Where did he come from?

He had been sent from the Man in Black from the Ring of Fire planet to save the galaxy from chaotic weather.
