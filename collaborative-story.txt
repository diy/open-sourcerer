Once upon a time, in a galaxy far, far away.  Things happened! It was snowy and sunny at the same time. 

Then, one day, something very, very big happened. A boy named Sue suddenly appeared! Where did he come from?

He had been sent from the Man in Black from the Ring of Fire planet to save the galaxy from chaotic weather.

He came down, down, down from that Burning Ring of Fire, where the
suns were hot, hot, hot and it never, ever snowed.

And Here I am !!
And he then transformed into a legendary Super Saiyan. Epic. 

And then there was rain and the rain was good.

And then he took his cloned fork and said "I gotta git to the hub for some chow!"

He chose the chow mein, and he would live to regret it.

And then I woke up! That was a strange dream.. The weather outside is fine and all three suns shine bright in the sky.
