Once upon a time, in a galaxy far, far away.  Things happened! It was snowy and sunny at the same time. 

Then, one day, something very, very big happened. A boy named Sue suddenly appeared! Where did he come from?

He had been sent from the Man in Black from the Ring of Fire planet to save the galaxy from chaotic weather.

He came down, down, down from that Burning Ring of Fire, where the
suns were hot, hot, hot and it never, ever snowed.

And Here I am !!
And he then transformed into a legendary Super Saiyan. Epic. 

And then there was rain and the rain was good.

And then he took his cloned fork and said "I gotta git to the hub for some chow!"

He chose the chow mein, and he would live to regret it.

And then I woke up! That was a strange dream.. The weather outside is fine and all three suns shine bright in the sky.

he looked outside but he was like no i want to learn stuff about open sourcing! so he went on diy and learnedt stuff NEXT DAY his mind trobbing of new leanding he went on diy to learend some more and he got mo knowledge on the web dezelopemeant.

So it went for some time. After a quick breakfast of Fiber One cereal, for above all he craved regularity, he sat down at his MacBook.

His MacBook had a cat sitting on top of it.
